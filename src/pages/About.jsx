              <h1>Our founding story</h1>
              <p>Our e-learning platform was born out of a shared vision and passion for transforming education. It all began with a group of educators, technologists, and lifelong learners who recognized the need for accessible, flexible, and high-quality learning opportunities in a rapidly evolving digital world.</p>
              <p>As experienced educators ourselves, we witnessed firsthand the limitations and challenges of traditional education systems. We believed that education should not be confined to the walls of a classroom or restricted by geographical boundaries. We envisioned a platform that could bridge these gaps and empower individuals from all walks of life to unlock their full potential.</p>
